# Car Review Analysis Report: LLM-Based Sentiment Analysis and Topic Extraction

## Introduction

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of car review sentiment and topic extraction using multiple Large Language Model (LLM) approaches. The analysis covers 1,224 car reviews with binary sentiment labels that have been expanded to include neutral sentiment classification. The study implements cutting-edge LLM techniques including RoBERTa-based sentiment analysis, OpenAI GPT-3.5 zero-shot classification, and advanced topic extraction methods combining embedding-based clustering with LLM interpretation.

The automotive industry faces increasing competition and customer scrutiny, making understanding customer sentiment and identifying key discussion topics crucial for product development and marketing strategies. This analysis demonstrates how modern LLM approaches can provide deeper insights into customer feedback compared to traditional methods.
